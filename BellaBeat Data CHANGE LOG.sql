Null Values:
1. I removed the "fat" column from the weighloginfo dataset because it only had two values, rendering it unsuitable for my research.
2. Using Excel, I utilized the filter tools to look for null values across the dataset. There weren't any.

Duplicate Values:
1. Throughout the dataset, I checked for values that were duplicated. They didn't exist.

Structural Errors:
1. Checked for structural errors in the datsets, they weren't any.
2. By changing all of the values to 2d.p, I ensured that all of the numeric values are consistent.

Standardidzing Date and Time Columns:
1. To ensure that all dates were consistent, I formatted the date column to read YYYY-MM-DD.
2. In the datetime columns, time is separated from date.

Populating the dataset:
1. From the date columns, a column for the day of the week was established.
2. From the date columns, a column for the month was also created. 

Validation:
1. I checked at the conclusion of the data cleaning procedure to see if the data:
  . madke sense?
  . follow the relevant rules for its field?
  . substantiate or invalidate my working idea, or reveal any new information?
